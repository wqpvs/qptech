1.7.6
- BUGFIX: Mixer crashing server
- tweak: only 2 concrete instead of 8 in mixer (to match with cobblestone recipes) (uses only 250ml of dye now)

1.7.5
- BUGFIX: potential crash with wirerender
- BUGFIX: fixed tin wire -> copper wire recipe

1.7.4
- BUGFIX: Macerator corrupting vanilla crushing and grinding recipes
- can make item transport pipes with iron or steel channels
- Mixer update:
	- liquid rubber recipe
	- [enabled output to liquid tank]
- cable extruder added - makes cables from liquid rubber, sulfur, and resin
- added industrial blower block - added blister steel recipe to the advanced bloomery
- adding client side config file and way to turn off item pipe items
	- command .showitempipecontents true|false
		- if set to false it will not render the items going thru pipes which should help performance in some cases
- added serverside config (qptechserverconfig.json)
	- maceratorsinglemode - if set to true macerators will only output a single itemstack (Helpful in cases were items might have a crushing recipe and a maceration recipe)
		- item will randomly be selected
		- I will hopefully find a better solution to double macerator output
- changed cable graphics to a spool and moved to main qptech tab in creative screen
- changed wire graphics to a spool
- deprecating tin wire, now craftable directly into copper wire so you can get something back for it


- todo:
	- Macerator set to pulverize or grind modes?
		- (for now added a single output server option)
	
	- power node recipe - maybe use a glass mould and add a glass machine?
	
	


1.7.3
- ground storage settings from Craluminum thanks!
- itemsplitters will automatcially set i/o faces to match item pipes on placement, as well as match up with any setup itemsplitters
- fixed macerator(and some related machiens) not outputing proper items issue
- fixed incorrect description on bloomery
- [experimental]you can now connect most electrical devices with cables
	- [creative]added power nodes for long distance power transmission (uses cables)



1.7.2
- crucible block overflows?
- macerator - should now process all items with CrushingProperties and all GrindingProperties
- lathe - outputs 5 rods plus 5 metal bits per ingot

1.7.1
- industrial glass can now be chiseled!
- added recipes for Industrial mixer (sowee) and language entries for temporal steel

1.7.0
New Stuff
- Item Transport system!
	- Item Pipes - move items between containers! 
		- powerful filter system: allow/block matching by item codes,
				- can be set to transfer only a certain amount of items at a time
				- crate and barrel aware (but not Pottery Barn aware) Will stop loading when a barrel can be sealed. Will auto filter itself to an attached crate.
		- change direction with a wrench (it will keep its filter, but drop its item)
		- faster versions to be added in the future
	- Item Splitters
		- configurable with wrench to set each side to input or output
		- will try and even out which directions stacks are sent
			- gives priority to an attached item pipe with a matching code
		- will only send items to another splitter or to an item pipe, can't extract or push items into containers itself
	- Computer tool (Currently creative only)
		- copy, paste, and clear item filters from item pipes
- New Machine - Mixer - used to make specific qptech recipes right now, takes in liquid and items
	- has a purge function which will either vent any liquids or dump them into a fluid tank underneath the mixer
	- change between fill and purge modes with the wrench
- New Machine - Coal Stoker - keep your steel cooking!
	- loaded with item pipes - either charcoal or coke
	- auto builds a charcoal pile on top of itself and will try to keep the charcoal pile at around 8 units
	- will auto-ignite if it detects a filled coffin above it (as part of a cementation furnace)
		- careful! you don't want to end up being the source of extra carbon in your steel!
- New Decorative Blocks
	- Concrete - made in a mixer with dye, sand, stones, and quicklime
		- variants available in each dye color
		- (a rough variant also available made with just water
	- Industrial Glass - frameless glass blocks made in a mixer from Crushed Quartz and water
- New Parts and materials:
	- steel channels, circuit boards, temporal steel (made in mixer)
- (experimental!)ropes and power poles (creative only) for power transfer.

Fixes & Tweaks
- fixed recipes for castiron ovens
- doubled mv generator power output to 64 tf
- mv heater quartered power usage to 32 tf
- fixed assembler type machines to try harder to find open slots
- several blocks made ground storable, thanks Craluminium!
- bugfixes - hopefully stabilized some of the devices erroring out and doing weird stuff
- fixed recipes for castiron ovens
- fixed bug: mixer won't change liquid types even when empty
- fixed: some machines stuck on warmpup
- Recipe processor recipe lists can be partially matched
- started adding some helpful links and such in item descriptions
- Bloomery machine can now work blister steel ingots, now called Advanced Bloomery Machine
- heating coils now stack so mv heater can actually be made!
